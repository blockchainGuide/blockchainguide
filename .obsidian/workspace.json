(Windows only) Run `pip3 install psutil==5.9.5 pywinctl==0.0.50 typing_extensions==4.7.1`. <!-- Update `README.md`, `magic.ts`, and `requirements.txt` together. -->\n    3. Configure Python executable in profile settings. Press the \"Check\" button to validate the Python configuration. Each profile needs to be configured separately.\n3. Enable plugin.\n4. (optional) Configure plugin settings.\n\n## Usage\n\n- To start a new external or integrated terminal\n  - Ribbon\n      1. Click on the `Open terminal` ribbon.\n      2. Choose the desired profile.\n  - Context menu\n      1. Right-click on files, folders, or tab headers.\n      2. Choose the desired action \\(and profile\\).\n  - Command palette\n      1. Press `Ctrl`+`P` or click on the `Open command palette` ribbon next to the left window border.\n      2. Choose the desired action \\(and profile\\).\n  - Select profile modal\n      1. Choose the desired profile. Press `Ctrl` to edit the profile before use. The item `(Temporary profile)` starts a terminal with a temporary profile.\n- To save and restore integrated terminal history\n    1. Keep the terminal open when exiting Obsidian.\n    2. Terminal history will be restored next time Obsidian is opened.\n- Additional actions\n  - Includes\n    - Clear terminal: \\(1\\), \\(4\\)\n    - Copy terminal: \\(1\\)\n    - Edit terminal: \\(1\\)\n    - Export, import, or edit settings: \\(2\\), \\(3\\)\n    - Find in terminal: \\(1\\), \\(4\\)\n    - Open documentation: \\(2\\), \\(3\\)\n    - Restart terminal: \\(1\\)\n    - Save terminal history: \\(1\\)\n  - Available by\n    - \\(1\\) Right-click on tab header/`More options`\n    - \\(2\\) Open settings\n    - \\(3\\) Open command palette\n    - \\(4\\) Use keyboard shortcuts\n\n### Keyboard shortcuts\n\nThe keyboard shortcuts can be customized in hotkeys settings.\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->\n__Global__\n\n- Toggle focus on last terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`` ` ``\n  - Focus on last terminal: \\(unbound; useful if you want separate keys for focus and unfocus\\)\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->\n__Terminal is focused__\n\nWhen a terminal is focused, other keyboard shortcuts \\(including Obsidian and plugin hotkeys\\) are disabled. Only the following keyboard shortcuts work. Thus you can ignore Obsidian complaining about conflicting keys for the following keyboard shortcuts.\n\n- Clear terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`K`, `Command`+`Shift`+`K` \\(Apple\\)\n- Close terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`W`, `Command`+`Shift`+`W` \\(Apple\\)\n- Find in terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`F`, `Command`+`Shift`+`F` \\(Apple\\)\n- Toggle focus on last terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`` ` `` \\(same as above\\)\n  - Unfocus terminal: \\(unbound; useful if you want separate keys for focus and unfocus\\)\n\n### Theming\n\nTheming is possible. However, there is no user-friendly interface for now.\n\n1. Open the profile editing modal.\n2. Click on the `Edit` button labeled `Data`. It should open up a new modal in which there is a large textbox.\n3. Notice `terminalOptions` in the text area labeled `Data`. Refer to the [`xterm.js` documentation](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/master/typings/xterm.d.ts#L26) (`ITerminalOptions`) to set the options. Nested objects may need to be used.\n4. Save the profile. Changes should apply immediately.\n\n### Profiles\n\nThis plugin comes with several profile presets that you can reference.\n\nWhen setting up a terminal profile, you need to distinguish between shells and terminal emulators. (Search online if needed.) Generally, integrated profiles only work with shells while external ones only work with terminal emulators.\n\n#### Examples\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->\n__Shells__\n\n- Bash: `bash`\n- Bourne shell: `sh`\n- Command Prompt: `cmd`\n- Dash: `dash`\n- Git Bash: `<Git installation>\\bin\\bash.exe` (e.g. `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`)\n- PowerShell Core: `pwsh`\n- Windows PowerShell: `powershell`\n- Windows Subsystem for Linux: `wsl` or `wsl -d <distribution name>`\n- Z shell: `zsh`\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->\n__Terminal emulators__\n\n- Command Prompt: `cmd`\n- GNOME Terminal: `gnome-terminal`\n- Konsole: `konsole`\n- Terminal (macOS): `/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/macOS/Terminal \"$PWD\"`\n- Windows Terminal: `wt`\n- iTerm2: `/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2 \"$PWD\"`\n- xterm: `xterm`\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nThis plugin patches `require` so that `require(\"obsidian\")` and other Obsidian modules work in the developer console. It is toggleable as `Expose internal modules` in settings.\n\nIn the developer console, a context variable `$$` is passed into the code, which can be used to dynamically change terminal options.\n\nThe full API is available from [`src/@types/obsidian-terminal.ts`](src/%40types/obsidian-terminal.ts).\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- Is the plugin useful on mobile?\n  - Compared to on desktop, it is much less useful. The only use for it for now is opening a developer console on mobile.\n- Why do hotkeys not work?\n  - If the terminal is in focus, all Obsidian hotkeys are disabled so that you can type special characters into the terminal. You can unfocus the terminal by pressing `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`` ` ``, then you can use Obsidian hotkeys again.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!\n\nThis project uses [`changesets`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage the changelog. When creating a pull request, please [add a changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md#adding-changesets) describing the changes. Add multiple changesets if your pull request changes several things. End each changeset with `([PR number](PR link) by [author username](author link))`. For example, the newly created file under the directory `.changeset` should look like:\n\n```Markdown\n---\n\"example\": patch\n---\n\nThis is an example change. ([GH#1](https://github.com/ghost/example/pull/1) by [@ghost](https://github.com/ghost))\n```\n\n### Todos\n\nThe todos here, ordered alphabetically, are things planned for the plugin. There are no guarantees that they will be completed. However, we are likely to accept contributions for them.\n\n- Connect to remote shells.\n- Detect sandboxed environment and notify users.\n- External link confirmation.\n- Filter console log by severity in the developer console.\n- Indicate that the terminal resizer has crashed or is disabled.\n- Shared terminal tabs.\n- Vim mode switch.\n\n### Translating\n\nTranslation files are under [`assets/locales/`](assets/locales/). Each locale has its own directory named with its corresponding __[IETF language tag](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag)__. Some translation keys are missing here and instead located at [`obsidian-plugin-library`][plugin library].\n\nTo contribute translation for an existing locale, modify the files in the corresponding directory.\n\nFor a new locale, create a new directory named with its language tag and copy [`assets/locales/en/translation.json`](assets/locales/en/translation.json) into it. Then, add an entry to [`assets/locales/en/language.json`](assets/locales/en/language.json) in this format:\n\n```JSONc\n{\n    // ...\n    \"en\": \"English\",\n    \"(your-language-tag)\": \"(Native name of your language)\",\n    \"uwu\": \"Uwuish\",\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nSort the list of languages by the alphabetical order of their language tags. Then modify the files in the new directory. There will be errors in [`assets/locales.ts`](assets/locales.ts), which you can ignore and we will fix them for you. You are welcome to fix them yourself if you know TypeScript.\n\nWhen translating, keep in mind the following things:\n\n- Do not translate anything between `{{` and `}}` (`{{example}}`). They are __interpolations__ and will be replaced by localized strings at runtime.\n- Do not translate anything between `$t(` and `)` (`$t(example)`). They refer to other localized strings. To find the localized string being referred to, follow the path of the key, which is separated by dots (`.`). For example, the key [`youtu.be./dQw4w9WgXcQ`](https://youtu.be./dQw4w9WgXcQ) refers to:\n\n```JSONc\n{\n    // ...\n    \"youtu\": {\n        // ...\n        \"be\": {\n            // ...\n            \"/dQw4w9WgXcQ\": \"I am 'youtu.be./dQw4w9WgXcQ'!\",\n            // ...\n        },\n        // ...\n    },\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n- The keys under `generic` are vocabularies. They can be referred in translation strings by `$t(generic.key)`. Refer to them as much as possible to standardize translations for vocabularies that appear in different places.\n- It is okay to move interpolations and references to other localized strings around to make the translation natural. It is also okay to not use some references used in the original translation. However, it is NOT okay to not use all interpolations.\n\n## Security\n\nWe hope that there will never be any security vulnerabilities, but unfortunately it does happen. Please [report](#reporting-a-vulnerability) them!\n\n### Supported versions\n\n| Version | Supported |\n|-|-|\n| latest | ✅ |\n| outdated | ❌ |\n\n### Reporting a vulnerability\n\nPlease report a vulnerability by opening an new issue. We will get back to you as soon as possible.\n",

(Does not include updating from a previous version to this version.)\n- Please reset your settings and reconfigure it.\n- Linux, macOS: Please specify a terminal emulator (not a shell) for external terminal, and a shell (not a terminal emulator) for internal terminal.\n- macOS: This is not necessary if you have only used the release versions. But just in case, you might need to reset settings to apply the external terminal cwd fix.\n- macOS: The external terminal cwd fix is implemented by passing `$PWD` as the first argument to the external terminal. This might cause issues with non-default terminals. You may need to edit `executables.darwin.extArgs` in `.obsidian/plugins/terminal/data.json` to remove the first argument. Also see the hint.\n- mobile: You can only change settings on mobile for now.\n- Hint: There are hidden settings to set the launching arguments in `.obsidian/plugins/terminal/data.json`. Search for `intArgs` and `extArgs`. I still need to figure out how to present the hidden settings in the settings UI well.\n\n### Features\n\n- Terminal view no longer closes when the underlying process terminates. (`934eb24e2c7106e1122c8c29e4160ca5d55749ef`)\n- Add terminal restoration message in the format of `* Restored history at (time)`.

(`a80466f309483f6971c29b85d5825449ab93c448`)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Terminal view persists when updating the plugin. (`934eb24e2c7106e1122c8c29e4160ca5d55749ef`)\n- Windows: Pressing `Ctrl-C` will no longer close the resizer sometimes.

Python 3.10/+ is required but Python packages `psutil` and `pywinctl` are no longer required on Unix platforms. This should address the problem with integrated terminals of [GH#2](https://github.com/polyipseity/obsidian-terminal/issues/2).
